When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?

While working with other collaborators, or when creating an
open source project. Basically any time you would like to be able
to share your work while still maintaining the ability to
continue privately. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if Git stayed up to date with your remote repository you may
be pulling in changes that other people have made, or you just may
want to work on something locally and then push it on to the git 
repository. In essence its just simpler if the local and remote
repositories remain separate other than when users attempt to change
things themselves.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would 
you use one instead of the other?

forks are used to create a clone of a project that is already on github. 
Forks are especially useful if you don't have permission to collaborate
on a project. Clones are useful if you want to take a project that already
exists on your own github, and bring it to your local file. Branches are 
useful in Git and Github projects that you have control over. They let
you create more or less a check point or split check point where you can
develop your program in two different directions. Or even try implementing
completely separate features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You can always check to see if you are ahead or behind the remote
