What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you intialize a repository you create a .git folder and basically set
up the repository for git to create commits and everything else. Key to
notice that the git init command does not actually commit anything
and you must manually select which fiels you are going to add to any 
commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is more abstract than the working directory and
the repository. While the repository represents a group of files
and the working directory represents the file or set of files
which are in focus, the staging area is only the representation
of files, and cannot be directly read to or from.
